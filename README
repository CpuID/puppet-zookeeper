puppet-zookeeper
================

Zookeeper installation and configuration for puppet. Allows you to install a
zookeeper server cluster easily. Generally a good idea to use it with an
orchestration engine like Mcollective as you will need to run each
zookeeper puppet configuration a couple times to pull in all node definitions.

Usage
-----
	node 'zookeeper' {
	  class { 'zookeeper':
	    server_name => $::ipaddress,
	  }
	}
